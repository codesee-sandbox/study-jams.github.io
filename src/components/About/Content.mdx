We're a volunteer-run study group for all things programming. Heavy emphasis on all things.

Our goal is to learn all things coding together, and that is in the loosest sense of the word. Be it through projects, challenges, or even just having a chat, the aim is to learn!

# That sounds fun! What programming language do you do?

Whichever you like. We mean it! The whole point of *Study Jams* is to explore
**all things programming**. That includes the programming language you're
wondering about.

# Hey, but I have no idea what I could contribute...

Let me stop you there. That's totally fine! The whole point of a study group is
to learn together, meaning there's always something to do!

Maybe you've:

- Got something you'd like to do a little **show & tell**.
- Read about something interesting and want to share it.
- Heard so much about `<insert technology here>` and want to try it out.
- Been stuck on an issue for *ages* and want a hand.
- Got a talk recommendation.

This is only the beginning! Maybe you've got a different reason for coming along!
