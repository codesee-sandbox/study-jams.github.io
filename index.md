# Hey you!

Are you a budding software developer? Are you an experienced software developer? Are you interested in starting out in programming?

# Fantastic.

We're a biweekly (that is, meeting every two weeks) volunteer-run study group for all things programming?

# What's a study group?

Well for starters, it isn't as strict as it sounds. **For one thing, there are no exams!**.

Our goal is to learn all things coding together, and that is in the loosest sense of the word. Be it through projects, challenges, or even just having a chat, the aim is to learn!

# So where and when do you meet?

We meet **every two Wednesdays** at Wikimedia Austria's office:

Wikimedia Ã–sterreich
Stolzenthalergasse 7/1
1080 Wien

# Alright that answers where, but what about when?

TODO

# That sounds fun! What programming language do you do?

Whichever you like. We mean it! The whole point of *Study Jams* is to explore **all things programming**. That includes the programming language you're wondering about.

# Hey, but I have no idea what I could contribute...

Let me stop you there. That's totally fine! The whole point of a study group is to learn together, meaning there's always something to do!

Maybe you've:

- Got something you'd like to do a little **show & tell**.
- Read about something interesting and want to share it.
- Heard so much about `<insert technology here>` and want to try it out.
- Been stuck on an issue for *ages* and want a hand.
- Got a talk recommendation.

This is only the beginning! Maybe you've got a different reason for coming along!
