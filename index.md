# Hey you!

Are you a budding software developer? Are you an experienced software
developer? Are you interested in starting out in programming?

# Fantastic.

We're a biweekly (that is, meeting every two weeks) volunteer-run study group
for all things programming.

# What's a study group?

Well for starters, it isn't as strict as it sounds. **For one thing, there are
no exams!**.

Our goal is to learn all things coding together, and that is in the loosest
sense of the word. Be it through projects, challenges, or even just having a
chat, the aim is to learn!

# So where and when do you meet?

We meet **every two Wednesdays** at Wikimedia Austria's office:

Wikimedia Ã–sterreich
Stolzenthalergasse 7/1
1080 Wien

# When's the next meeting?

- Wednesday, **November 13th at 18:30** (cooperation with [Wikidata Wednesday](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:Events/Vienna))
- Wednesday, **November 27th at 18:30**

# What's the general schedule like?

Most of the time it's fairly loose. However, we do have a few slots for show
and tell.

It's totally cool to come and hack with your headphones on. In fact, we have a
rule that if someone's rockin' the headphones they won't be disturbed.

# That sounds fun! What programming language do you do?

Whichever you like. We mean it! The whole point of *Study Jams* is to explore
**all things programming**. That includes the programming language you're
wondering about.

# Hey, but I have no idea what I could contribute...

Let me stop you there. That's totally fine! The whole point of a study group is
to learn together, meaning there's always something to do!

Maybe you've:

- Got something you'd like to do a little **show & tell**.
- Read about something interesting and want to share it.
- Heard so much about `<insert technology here>` and want to try it out.
- Been stuck on an issue for *ages* and want a hand.
- Got a talk recommendation.

This is only the beginning! Maybe you've got a different reason for coming along!
